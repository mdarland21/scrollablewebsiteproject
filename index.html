        <h2>National Parks of California</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Death Valley</h3></li>
                <p>In this below-sea-level basin, steady drought and 
                    record summer heat make Death Valley a land of 
                    extremes. Yet, each extreme has a striking contrast. 
                    Towering peaks are frosted with winter snow. Rare 
                    rainstorms bring vast fields of wildflowers. Lush 
                    oases harbor tiny fish and refuge for wildlife and 
                    humans. Despite its morbid name, a great diversity of 
                    life thrives in Death Valley.</p>
            <li><h3>Channel Islands</h3></li>
                <p>Channel Islands National Park encompasses five remarkable 
                    islands and their ocean environment, preserving and 
                    protecting a wealth of natural and cultural resources. 
                    Isolation over thousands of years has created unique 
                    animals, plants, and archeological resources found 
                    nowhere else on Earth and helped preserve a place 
                    where visitors can experience coastal southern 
                    California as it once was.</p>
            <li><h3>Joshua Tree</h3></li>
                <p>Two distinct desert ecosystems, the Mojave and the 
                    Colorado, come together in Joshua Tree National Park. 
                    A fascinating variety of plants and animals make their 
                    homes in a land sculpted by strong winds and 
                    occasional torrents of rain. Dark night skies, a rich 
                    cultural history, and surreal geologic features add to 
                    the wonder of this vast wilderness in southern 
                    California. Come explore for yourself.</p>
            <li><h3>Lassen Volcanic</h3></li>
                <p>Lassen Volcanic National Park is home to steaming 
                    fumaroles, meadows freckled with wildflowers, clear 
                    mountain lakes, and numerous volcanoes. Jagged peaks 
                    tell the story of its eruptive past while hot water 
                    continues to shape the land.</p>
            <li><h3>Pinnacles</h3></li>
                <p>Some 23 million years ago multiple volcanoes erupted, 
                    flowed, and slid to form what would become Pinnacles 
                    National Park. What remains is a unique landscape. 
                    Travelers journey through chaparral, oak woodlands, 
                    and canyon bottoms. Hikers enter rare talus caves and 
                    emerge to towering rock spires teeming with life: 
                    prairie and peregrine falcons, golden eagles, and the 
                    inspiring California condor.</p>
            <li><h3>Redwood</h3></li>
                <p>Most people know Redwood as home to the tallest trees 
                    on Earth. But the Parks also protect vast prairies, 
                    oak woodlands, wild rivers, and 40 miles of rugged 
                    coastline. People have lived in this verdant landscape 
                    since time immemorial. Together, the National Park 
                    Service and California State Parks are managing and 
                    restoring these lands for the inspiration, enjoyment, 
                    and education of all.</p>
            <li><h3>Sequoia & Kings Canyon</h3></li>
                <p>Huge mountains, rugged foothills, deep canyons, vast 
                    caverns, and the worldâ€™s largest trees exemplify the 
                    diversity of landscapes, life, and beauty here. 
                    Explore these pages to learn about the plants and 
                    animals here and the threats they face. Our ancient 
                    giant sequoias may seem invincible, but they, too are 
                    vulnerable</p>
            <li><h3>Yosemite</h3></li>
                <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human 
                    foresight, the strength of granite, the power of 
                    glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility 
                    of the High Sierra. First protected in 1864, Yosemite 
                    National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but 
                    within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find 
                    deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, 
                    a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>
